Sean Axmaker,"The Wachowskis may have something in their theory that the world is simply a complex operating system humans are simply virtual programs.... Their dialogue feels written by a computer program, and for that matter acted by a collection of CGI figures.",rotten,"Sep 9, 2023",Stream on Demand
Brian Eggert,"Perhaps it’s wrong and narrow-minded to hope that the Wachowskis would only live up to their original film, but their brand of mythology expansion narrows the possibilities and limits the viewer’s enjoyment of this universe.",rotten,"Jul 12, 2022",Deep Focus Review
Mike Massie,"Just as much as the last entry was a piece of a story, this one is a fragment, telling so little of the yarn that it’s the least complex and most inessential of the series, save for the fact that it finally wraps up character loose ends.",rotten,"Jul 11, 2022",Gone With The Twins
David Hogan,"There are things to like in the opening moments and the final showdown but the rest is either dull or visually unappealing CG bullet-fest scenes... or both, I guess.",rotten,"Dec 22, 2021",hoganreviews.co.uk
David Walsh,"One only trusts that some of those who made vast and overextended claims for the first part of the trilogy have been awakened to reality by this latest nonsense, with any luck by the sound of their own howls of laughter.",rotten,"Feb 15, 2021",World Socialist Web Site
Micheal Compton,"Billed as the final chapter, the [Wachowskis] cop out and leave hints of a potential fourth film. Here's a suggestion: Dump the franchise, because this series has clearly overstayed its welcome.",rotten,"Nov 15, 2019",Bowling Green Daily News

Joel Siegel,There's great storytelling - some of Hollywood's best ever. The story takes jaw-dropping turns.,fresh,"Jan 4, 2018",Good Morning America
Kevin Carr,The Wachowski Brothers kept true to their original story.,fresh,"Jan 12, 2016",Fat Guys at the Movies
Tim Brayton,"Averages out to be a mildly better film than The Matrix Reloaded, mostly on account of being neither as good nor as bad in its peaks and valleys.",rotten,"May 31, 2012",Antagony & Ecstasy
Nell Minow,"Finale with same heavy violence, weaker script.",rotten,"Dec 28, 2010",Common Sense Media

Mark Halverson,,fresh,"Aug 7, 2008",Sacramento News & Review
Rob Gonsalves,"Some of this stuff is just cheesy in the same way it's been cheesy in dozens of cheaper, less cultish films.",rotten,"Mar 11, 2008",Rob's Movie Vault
Joe Lozito,,rotten,"Jul 14, 2007",Big Picture Big Sound
Wesley Lovell,It's amazing how such a brilliant opening film can devolve into nothing but uninteresting fight scenes and unnecessary visual effects.,rotten,"Aug 8, 2006",Cinema Sight
Daniel Schweiger,Not in my memory has a film been filled with such a succession of ejaculatory FX shots that cover any semblance of story in goo.,fresh,"Dec 6, 2005",Film Threat
